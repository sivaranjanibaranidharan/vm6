    <h1>Cultural Heritage Of Thanjavur</h1>
    <p>The cultural history of Thanjavur makes it a goldmine for art lovers. Given that it was ruled by different dynasties during different periods, its cultural milieu has become an amalgamation of each of these reigns. Right from the Cholas (8th to 13th century) to the Marathas (the last dynasty to rule Thanjavur in the 19th century before the arrival of the British), Thanjavur to this day reflects the richness of its past. It also helped shape the modern-day Tamil culture significantly.

        <hr>Presently, Thanjavur boasts three geographical indicators granted by the Government of India (a geographical indicator is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation native to that place of origin)â€”Thanjavur Veena (a musical instrument), Thanjavur dolls and Thanjavur paintings.
        <hr>Thanjavur led the field of music and dance of South India for more than 800 years. Many musical ideas and theories used today, such as the 72 Melakarta system, emerged from this place.

        Talking particularly about the music scene, Thanjavur and its region were instrumental in the promulgation of Carnatic music (a type of music native to the Southern Indian region). Some of the finest composers/saints of classical Carnatic music, Syama Sastri, Muthuswami Dikshithar, and Tyagharaja Bhagavathar belonged to this region.
        
        Further, Thanjavur is also known for the musical instruments it produces. Now a geographical indicator, some of the best quality Veenas originate from Thanjavur.  The Thanjavur Veena or Raghunatha Nayaka Mela Veena is named after Raghunatha Nayak (1600-1634), a master of the Veena who perfected the version with 24 fixed frets and four playing strings. This helped shape the present-day version of the Veena</p>
