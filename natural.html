    <h1>History of Thanjavur</h1>
    <p>
      This place was previously called Śiyāli. Indra once fled to this place in
      fear of the asura called Śūrapadma and did tapas here. There are no
      references to Thanjavur in the Sangam period Tamil records, though some
      scholars believe that the city has existed since that time. Kovil Venni,
      situated 15 miles (24 km) to the east of the city, was the site of the
      Battle of Venni between the Chola king Karikala and a confederacy of the
      Cheras and the Pandyas. The Cholas seemed to have faced an invasion of the
      Kalabhras in the third century CE after which the kingdom faded into
      obscurity. The region around present day Thanjavur was conquered by the
      Mutharayars during the sixth century, who ruled it up to 849. The Cholas
      came to prominence once more through the rise of the Medieval Chola
      monarch Vijayalaya (841–878 CE) in about 850 CE. Vijayalaya conquered
      Thanjavur from the Mutharayar king Elango Mutharayar and built a temple
      dedicated to the Hindu goddess Nisumbhasudani. His son Aditya I (871–901)
      consolidated their hold over the city. The Rashtrakuta king Krishna II
      (878–914), a contemporary of the Chola king Parantaka I (907–950), claims
      to have conquered Thanjavur, but there are no records to support the
      claim. Gradually, Thanjavur became the most important city in the Chola
      Empire and remained its capital till the emergence of Gangaikonda
      Cholapuram in about 1025. During the first decade of the eleventh century,
      the Chola king Raja Raja Chola I (985–1014) constructed the Brihadeeswarar
      Temple at Thanjavur. The temple is considered to be one of the best
      specimens of Tamil architecture. When the Chola Empire began to decline in
      the 13th century, the Pandyas from the south invaded and captured
      Thanjavur twice, first between 1218–19 and again in 1230. During the
      second invasion, the Chola king Rajaraja III (1216–56) was exiled and he
      sought the help of the Hoysala king Vira Narasimha II (1220–35) to regain
      Thanjavur. Thanjavur was eventually annexed along with the rest of the
      Chola kingdom by the Pandya king Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I
      (1268–1308) in 1279 and the Chola kings were forced to accept the
      suzerainty of the Pandyas. The Pandyas ruled Thanjavur from 1279 to 1311
      when their kingdom was raided by the forces of Malik Kafur (1296–1306) and
      later annexed by the Delhi Sultanate. The Sultanate extended its authority
      directly over the conquered regions from 1311 to 1335 and then through the
      semi-independent Ma'bar Sultanate from 1335 to 1378. Starting from the
      1350s, the Ma'bar Sultanate was steadily absorbed into the rising
      Vijayanagar Empire.
