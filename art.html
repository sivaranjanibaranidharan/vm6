    <h1>History of Thanjavur Painting:</h1>
    <img 
    <p>The Thanjavur city of Tamil Nadu has contributed a lot to the history of Indian art. The city has been the heart of art and architecture for centuries. Thanjavur was the capital of the Chola dynasty from the 9th to the 13th century, and during this period, Thanjavur reached new heights in art and architecture. The Brihadeesvara temple is the symbol of this period and houses several wall paintings from the Chola Empire and Nayaka period.

        The roots of Tanjore Paintings are also linked to Thanjavur. The painting style originated and flourished here in the 16th and 17th centuries. The origin of this classical painting style is linked to the Vijayanagara Empire (1336 A.D. to 1646 A.D.), including the areas of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. The rulers of Vijayanagara were patrons of art and culture. The roots of this South Indian art form are linked to the Mural art of the Vijayanagara Empire.
        
        Tanjore Painting was first used for decorating the doors and walls of homes, palaces, and temples in Thanjavur. The interior walls of the palaces were also painted with depictions of various events like a coronation, battle victories, and other achievements of the rulers. In contrast, the walls of temples and homes were decorated with murals and paintings involving religious themes and portraits of various Hindu deities.  
        
        The remains of these ancient wall paintings are still present on the walls of Virupaksha Temple in Hampi, the capital city of Vijayanagara Empire, Varadaraja Temple, Kamakshi Temple in Kanchipuram, and Lepakshi Temple in Andhra Pradesh. Some of these paintings are also present in the Brihadeeswara Templeâ€™s gopuram of Periya Kovil in Thanjavur.
        
        During the reign of Vijayanagara, the Rayas of Vijayanagara administered the kingdom through Nayaka governors. These governors also administered the outlying states under the supervision of the Raya of Vijayanagara. During the reign of Achyutappa (1564-1614), the Vijayanagara empire fell, and several philosophers, artists, musicians, and litterateurs migrated to Thanjavur, Madurai, and Mysore. Raghunatha Nayaka, the son and successor of Achyutappa, was the most successful Nayaka ruler and patron of art and artists. He established a unique school for Thanjavur artists, who later evolved the Tanjore Painting style during the reign of Marathas.</p>
