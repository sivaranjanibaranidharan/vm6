    <h1>Foods of Thanjavur</h1>
    <p>
      The cuisine of Thanjavur is a mix of traditional Brahmin, Mukkulathor and
      Maratha cuisines, drawing from the communities that have lived in and
      around the area. The Maratha dynasty which ruled from 1674 -1855 AD had
      heavily influenced the cuisine of this region. The Thanjavur royal
      heirloom recipes use lots of chillies, freshly pounded spices thus making
      the food very rustic. The mashyache kebab (pan-fried poppy seeds and green
      chilli – meared fish fillets), komdiche kebab (chicken kebab with
      coriander, pepper and ginger), kesari maas (dry mutton mince with saffron
      and spices), kelyachi bhaji (raw banana tossed with karivadagam and hurit,
      a mixture made by roasting lentils, rice and sesame seeds and ground into
      a coarse powder) are a part of regular South Indian meal. What makes the
      food of the Thanjavur royal kitchen so unique is the distinct and
      unmistakable influence of the Marathas. The Kola urundai is an example
      which is very similar to Marathi Shunti kebab. In this, the fish is
      delicately tied with banana leaves into a ball shape and deep fried.
      Vegans can relish the Tambrahm style of cuisine because its assortment of
      dishes are creative products of the best vegetarian traditions of
      Brahmins. Tamil Brahmin cuisine is all about an exciting line-up of
      authentic vegetarian dishes born out of traditional culinary practices.
      These flavours are unlike any other varieties of Tamil Nadu cuisines.
      Tambrahm (Tamil Brahmin) dishes are generally less spicy, and all its
      recipes take the nutritional value of the ingredients into consideration.
      Typically, Tamil Brahmins combine breakfast and lunch into a heavy brunch
      at around 10-11 am. The gustatory treat is characterised by their Elai
      Saapadu (banana leaf meal), a fusion of all the flavoursome dishes that
      the cuisine is known for. The signature ones are Sambhar, Thogayal, Kootu,
      Paruppusili, Vatha Kuzhambu, Kichadi, Pachadi, Mor Kuzhambu, Ulunthuvada,
      and many more. The Tambrahm cuisine has two different styles of cooking,
      the Iyer and the Iyengar varieties. The cuisine has explored the infinite
      possibilities of vegetarian dishes, with the Iyer variety alone having 27
      types of sambhar and 45 types of rasam, some of which share similarities
      with the Iyengar style. The Iyengar style practises the satvic tradition
      by avoiding the use of onion or garlic while Iyer weddings are
      characterized by Vengaya sambhar made with shallots. The Brahmins use
      ‘Amudhu’ (translated as ‘nectar’) as a suffix to name their dishes. The
      tangy Rasam is called Sathamudhu; Poriyal (fried vegetables) is referred
      to as Karamudhu; and Payasam is known as Thirukanamadhu. The Iyengar vadas
      soaked in curd are known as Thayirvada, while the Iyer cuisine has vadas
      which are crispy and known as Aama vada, made of lentils. The desserts of
      Tambrahm cuisine are just as delicious and dissolve in your mouth from the
      very first bite. The famous Iyengar dessert known as Akkaravadisal is made
      from milk, ghee, jaggery, cashew, saffron, raisins and edible camphor
      while Iyer desserts are typically Kheer (rice or semolina) or traditional
      sweets like Mysore Pak. The heavenly Thirattippal is another Brahmin
      dessert made from condensed milk and jaggery. One can lose count of the
      number of rice dishes that a Tambrahm cuisine can whip up. Puliodhare,
      Kadamba sadham, Sambhar sadham, Thayir sadham, Lemon sadham, Coconut
      sadham are only a few of the mouth-watering ones. Fenugreek, known as
      Vendhayam in Tamil, is used generously in most dishes. Pepper, cumin,
      mustard seeds and asafoetida are the commonly used spices in Tambrahm
      cuisine. Another highlight of the cuisine is the freshly brewed filter
      coffee. There are fans around the globe for this sought-after aromatic
      coffee. Curd rice served with pickles is an integral part of the Brahmin
      meal, which is again considered good for the stomach. There are many
      canteens in Chennai that serve authentic Brahmin cuisine.
